## Wave Propagation

Simulation in 2D of a wave with a discretization of the wave equation. The user can add walls to the space and see the reflection and different patterns that emerge from a pure analytical approach to the wave's behaviour. The user can modify parameters like the frequency and the time of the simulation and also the position of the source. The file wave_display.py launch the application. 

## Early Reflections

2D space where the user can set up wall and see the reflections of the given geometry by moving the mouse.
