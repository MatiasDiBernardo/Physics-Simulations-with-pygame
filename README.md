#Wave Propagation
Simulation in 2D of a wave with a discretization of the wave equation. The user can add walls to the space and see the reflection and different patterns that emerge from a pure analytical approach to the wave's behaviour. The user can modify parameters like the frequency and the time of the simulation and also the position of the source.
